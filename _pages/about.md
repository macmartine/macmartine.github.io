Hey there! My name's Mac, and I like to build things, [teach things](resources), and [help entrepreneurs and startups](/services) develop their ideas. 

In the past I spent a decade at [Adobe](http://adobe.com), Founded a SaaS company, helped grow [an analytics startup](http://measureful.com) and [see it through an acquisition](http://chirpify.com). 
I've also built several iPhone games, and countless other apps along the way. Currently I'm focused on helping 
entrpreneurs, startups, and R&D departments of larger corporations hone and execute ideas.

<!--Iâ€™ve been the software business a long time, in varying capacities. True-Up Labs is the culmination of what clients have been coming to me for. It's what I'm good at, and it's what I love. (It feels great when those two things come together.)-->

<!--For the most part, True-Up Labs performs as a one-man-band. In striving to provide complete packages and well-rounded offerings, I pull in brilliant minds from various areas of expertise &mdash; designers, developers, product designers, marketers and writers.-->

I reside in Portland, Oregon with [my lovely wife](https://shannonsneed.contently.com), [two little boys](https://www.instagram.com/p/BHKJDlrgGbJ/) and [my bikes](https://www.instagram.com/p/lvCnF-rOR_/). We [travel](https://www.flickr.com/photos/macmartine), camp, [cook](http://macsmorsels.tumblr.com/), read by the fire, and occasionally nap. We try to keep things [simple](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1607747308/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1607747308&linkCode=as2&tag=macmartine-com-20&linkId=6ff2b65fff7fa216e250b909d123cc4e).
