# Q4 2016

### Looking back

I'm quite happy with what I've accomplished this past year in terms of the clients I've gotten,
relationships I've built, and the prices I've been able to charge.

I was initially nervous to ask for $125/hr, and now I'm easily clearing $200+/hr due to value-based pricing.

I've made $121,941.25 in my first 11 months of freelancing at what likely has amounted to about 50% of my time.

### Overview

While I plan to continue to build on my consulting business, my longer-term goal is to transition to building a product business.

### Freelance/Consulting

To help improve my consulting business I just signed up for <a href="https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/academy/">DYFAcademy</a>, scheduled to start Sept. 15, 2016.

**Goals for DYFA:**

* Hone in on positioning
* Create compelling messaging
* Create a lead generation plan

**Goals for freelancing/consulting:**

* Automate lead generation
* Stick to $25k+ MVP builds
* Outsource frontend development
* Reduce hourly work, and consolidate it, time-wise

### Product Business

In transitioning my focus to building a product business, my sole focus will be to:

* Build an email list

In doing so, I expect my other (product and freelance) goals to fall right into place:

* Double my income from this past year (as I expect the list to also generate consulting leads)
* Further define my audience
* Get product ideas

### Goals for next 12 months

* Acquire 1,500 email subscribers
* Make $250k
* Sell $5,000 in products
{: .bullets }

(Focusing on acquiring email subscribers should make the other items relatively easy)

### Goals for Q4 2016

* Acquire 250 email subscribers
* Make $35k
* Postitioning, outreach, offer (via DYFA)
{: .bullets }

(Focusing on acquiring email subscribers should make the other items relatively easy)

### Summary

So, it really all comes down to this:

**!!!Build an email list!!!**

## How to do it

* Create blog content
* Facebook promoted ads
