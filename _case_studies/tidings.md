intro: Tidings is a mobile-centric, but desktop friendly SaaS application which automates newsletter creation for Real Estate agents. Tidings is currently only available for users in Portland, Oregon. After Local Search Expert, David Mihm sold his first company, GetListed, to Moz, he came to me with the idea for Tidings.
content: David came to me with a clear vision and a fairly mature UI/UX. By definition, the objective for Phase 1 lay somewhere between an proof-of-concept and an MVP. Having done a fair amount of pre-validating, we were fairly confident of the desire for the target market to solve the particular problem we were solving. As with all solutions though, we didnâ€™t want to make too many assumptions before getting real-world feedback. Together, we slimmed down the proposed feature set by about 40% to save on cost and get to market sooner to validate and iterate.
