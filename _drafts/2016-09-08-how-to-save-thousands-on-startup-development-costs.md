* Day 1: Customer, not Product - Why you need to put the customer first

This is Day 1 of my email course on saving 1000's of dollars on startup and development costs. If you're not interested in receiving an email a day for the next few days, click here and I'll remove you from the email course.

Hey there, and welcome to the first lesson in your free How to Save $1000's in Startup Development Costs Email Course.

You probably were expecting to hear things like "Hire a developer in India for significantly less money!". Or, "Here's a coupon for 25% off your AWS hosting bill.".

No, no, no. Let's back up.

The goal for today is to convince you to stop writing code.

Now, you might be thinking:
"Stop writing code!? Why? I have to get this thing out there &mdash I've spent months on this thing, and I still have features to build &mdash; I've got to get this thing out the door!"

And my response:
"You've spent months building out a product that you don't have any customers for?"

You: "How could I have customers when I don't have a product?"

Let's stop right there &mdash; like one of those time-freeze moments from Saved By The Bell [**]

Let's back up and think about why we're building this product, and what problems it solves. If your reason for builng it is because you want to spend the rest of your life hopping from island to island sipping on colorful frozen beverages while your "set-it-and-forget-it" SaaS app funnels dollars into your bank account, go sign up for the Peace Corps, and commit the next year of your life to that instead.

* Day 3: Single Pain, Single Customer

Your main focus *needs* to be solving a problem for somebody, scratching an itch, releiving a pain. The entire startup process needs to revolve around that, and everything else will fall into place.

If you're able to touch on a painpoint, people will beg you for it. They'll keep coming back, they'll insist on havina solution &mdash; they'll give you money for it.

If you're able to touch on a painpoint, people will sigh in relieve, and tell their friends.

If you're able to touch on a painpoint, you've found your first customer. Once you've found your first customer, you can learn about them, where they hang out online and offline, what's important to them, what other pains they have that you can solve, and where you can find more people like them. You can then go search for these customers, starting with your first one, then your first 5, then 50. You get feedback, iterate, grow. Repeat, and repeat again.

"What if I can't find anyone in my target market to talk to me?", you ask.
Well, if you can't get them to talk to you now, how are you going to do it in 6 months?

Or, maybe you're just too confident for school:
"Well, I know my target market has this issue, it's just obvious. I'll figure out how to reach them when I'm ready."

Wrong You need to do this now. If you aren't worried about it, then just do it. Find one person.

Okay, so you've found someone who shares your sentiment &mdash; your real estate agent agrees that X is a pain..

 that's a good sign, but don't get too excited yet. What somebody says, and what they do, can turn out to be completely different things. Until they actually pull out their credit card, you haven't validated anything of value.

First, define who they are.
Then figure out where they are. 


Online vs. Offline

Your network (friends, family, LinkedIn, Twitter)

If you have an audience already, ask them:
* Email list
* Web surveys

Conferences, trade shows, brick and mortar.

Offer them something of value -- talk about them, offer to help, congratulate them, thank them, praise them.
