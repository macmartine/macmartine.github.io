  quote: "Mac is a rare (even one-of-a-kind, in my experience) combination of an extremely talented developer who's also reliable and an excellent communicator.  He understood my vision immediately, knew which details were important to ask about, and which to just plow ahead with, and delivered my MVP not only on-budget but a month ahead of schedule.  Not hyperbole: working with him was a huge source of relief that restored my faith in the universe after so many cost and time overruns with other projects.  I'm incredibly grateful for his execution and guidance on the early stages of Tidings and look forward to continuing to work with him. "
