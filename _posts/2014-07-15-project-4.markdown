description: "I invented, developed and launched Word Tower, my first native iOS application In short, it's Tetris meets Scrabble: As the letters fall, you can drag to place them, then select words from the wall of letters to make them disappear. Don't let the tower of letters reach the top of the screen -- if you do, it's game over! The graphics weren't sophisticated, but the code was. Word Tower was selected as a top feature in the iPhone App Store's game section."
