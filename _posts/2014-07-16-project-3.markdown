description: Under my own LLC, I ran a solo operation for a year and a half. During that time I conceived of, built and launched my own software as a service product: Evergreen, an appointment scheduling program. Evergreen enabled clients to schedule appointments with practitioners, and practitioners to manage their calendars and clients.
