### Books

I consume a lot of books on business, startups, marketing, persuasion psychology &mdash; and many other topics related to the startup process. Here is a list of what I've read in the recent past, and I continue to update this as the list grows. 

Lately I've been plucking more books from the <a href="https://personalmba.com/best-business-books/" target="_blank">Personal MBA reading list</a>, created by Josh Kaufman. I highly suggest checking out that list as well.

        </div>
        <div class="10u">
          <a href="{{ item.product_code }}">
            {{ item.title }}
          </a>

            {{ item.description }}
