Hey, what’s up!?

**I’m Mac Martine, a technology consultant and strategist specializing in system architecture and development for early-stage and funded startups.**

Every day, I help companies like yours:

* Align development with business goals
* Automate business processes
* Create efficient developer workflows
* Ensure they are using the most appropriate development and architectural tools for the job
* Avoid wasting time and resources on poor development practices, and deployments
* Rescue projects that have been neglected, or have not been properly maintained

In the recent past, I’ve:

* Taken an analytics SaaS start-up from **early stages through an acquisition** as the platform architect.
* Built SaaS applications single-handedly **from the ground up**.
* Contributed to various open source initiatives including Ruby on Rails.
* Ideated and developed several iOS applications.
* Worked for one of the best **Fortune 500 companies**, contributing to some of the best and most used software in the world.

I reside in Portland, Oregon with my lovely wife, two little boys and my bikes. We travel, camp, cook, read by the fire, and occasionally nap. We try to keep things simple.

> Mac is truly invested in the growth of our company and knocks himself out to make sure everything is running smoothly. I can say without hesitation, Mac is the best technology talent I’ve ever worked with, and he&#8217;s a world-class communicator, which makes such a difference.

If you need architecture or development guidance, help with payment systems, third-party API's, or general development, 
let's talk. I'm ready to get to know your business and help you talk it to the next level.

[//]: # Or, keep reading to find out more about how I can help.

[//]: # So many startups have development teams that are blind to the business goals. They are heads down 
[//]: # building features, but they aren't stepping back and looking at the project as a whole.  There is often
[//]: # a disconnect between those focused on market strategy and company direction, and those actually 
[//]: # buliding the software. Whether I'm simply consulting, and bridging that gap by helping implement 
[//]: # systems to improve effiencies and better transparency across teams, or implementing features myself, I will
[//]: # take the time to really dig deep to understand your company, your business goals, and your workflows. 
[//]: # This often results in discovery of development and process ineffeciencies that those too accustomed to the
[//]: # way things are, overlook.
